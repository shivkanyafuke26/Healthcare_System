# Healthcare_System1
For my final year project, I developed a Web application called " AI Healthcare Application" designed to help individuals to create an integrated healthcare platform that serves as a one-stop solution for the citizens of City. By amalgamating hospital profiles, virtual consultations, and an AI-driven chatbot, supplemented by a dedicated blood bank module, the web application aims to streamline the healthcare experience, from information gathering to medical consultations and critical blood related emergencies.
Certainly. The project I worked on encompasses three distinct modules aimed at improving healthcare accessibility and efficiency within a city. These modules include a blood bank, chatbot comprehensive database of hospital profiles, and a virtual consultation platform.
The hospital profiles module offers a centralized database of healthcare facilities within the city. Its key features include:
Hospital Search: Enabling users to search for hospitals based on criteria such as location, specialty services, and accreditation.
Detailed Profiles: Providing comprehensive information about each hospital, including contact details, services offered, facilities available, and patient reviews.
Geospatial Integration: Integrating with mapping services to display hospital locations on an interactive map for easy navigation.
In this project we used Technologies such as HTML, CSS, javascript and php for backend purpose.
